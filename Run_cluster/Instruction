Please run the bash scripts according to the following steps:

$ ./moose/scripts/stork.sh test_bash
$ cd test_bash
$ vim Makefile (activate the phase_field module)
$ make -j8
$ ./run_tests -j8
Upload the input files (csv, bash, slurm, input file) by FileZilla
$ ./run_scripts_revised.sh


1- The name of executive file is “test_bash-opt”, so please make a folder with name “test_bash” in the projects directory on R2. Otherwise, you have to change the executive file name in the “slurm-batch.bash” file based on the provided name for your folder.

2- Please use “-j8” (8 cores) for making your executive file and running the “run_tests”
$ make -j8
$./run_tests -j8

3- I have attached a csv file as well as input, slurm, and bash files, that you will uploaded them in the “test_bash” directory on R2.

$ ./ run_scripts_revised.sh
