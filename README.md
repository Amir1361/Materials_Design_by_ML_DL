# Materials_Design_by_ML_DL
By integrating state-of-the-art physics-based modeling along with microstructural quantification via machine learning, we invite multidisciplinary thinking in materials science, mathematics, and computer science, and offer a potential paradigm shift in developing Process-Structure-Property (PSP) linkages.
